Chord
============

**Chord** implements a chord diagram made with D3.js.

The data are manipulated using R and then converted into .json format.

The chart represents the total amount of imports by region for the year 2014 (depending on data availability, some countries like the Russian Federation are missing). Trade statistics used to build the dataset come from the World Tariff Profile 2016 publication and can be found in the databases of the WTO, ITC or UNCTAD. More information on the WTO web site: [**Statistics**](https://www.wto.org/statistics).
